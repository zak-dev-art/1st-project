        <h1>Hello, I am Zakayo Kagunda</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m a detail-oriented developer with experience across the full stack, 
                specializing in modern web technologies like React, Node.js, and TypeScript. 
                I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, user-friendly solutions and am always 
                exploring new tools and frameworks to stay current with industry trends. 
                Whether working independently or collaborating with a team, I strive to write clean, 
                maintainable code and deliver impactful results. With a background in both freelance 
                and professional development environments, I bring flexibility, communication, and 
                problem-solving skills to every project I work on.</p>
